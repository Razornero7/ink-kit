Ink Kit

## Install

```bash
npm install @inkonchain/ink-kit
```

## Usage

To use the components, you can import them directly:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@inkonchain/ink-kit";
```

To import the CSS, you can use the `style.css` export:

```tsx
import "@inkonchain/ink-kit/style.css";
```

Ink Kit classes are prefixed with `ink-`.

You can also use the CSS variables directly in your project instead of the tailwind classes.

## WIP Notice

This is a work in progress, we are working on it!
